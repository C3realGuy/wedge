/**
 * Handles a topic being locked from within the topic view, accessed via ?action=lock
 *
 * This function takes the current topic status and unlocks or locks it depending on the context.
 * - If the user is locking, and they are allowed to 'lock any topics', assuming it is a moderator and thus a moderator lock (1) should be used. Otherwise check it is their topic and they are allowed to lock their own - in which case, a user lock (2) should be used.
 * - If the user is unlocking, check whether it is a moderator lock (1) or user lock (2), and whether their permissions allow them to unlock the topic (unlock-any for moderator lock, unlock-own and their own topic and user lock only for user lock)
 * - Session validation is done based on the URL containing the normal session identifiers.
 * - The action will be logged in the moderation log (if enabled, see {@link logAction()}) - provided it is a moderator lock. Users locking their own topics (user locks) are not recorded.
 * - Send notifications to relevant users.
 * - Return to the topic once done.
